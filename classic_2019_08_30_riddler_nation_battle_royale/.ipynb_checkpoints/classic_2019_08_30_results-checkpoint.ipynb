       "\\n-The champion sets of the other two had about an 80% win rate. That seems like a good target for this time.\\n-The champion set from the second iteration would have done well on the first. It makes sense to make something that would have done well in the others.\\n-The champion set from the first iteration would have gotten obliterated in the second. It's a good idea not to repeat either of the champions.\\n-The top sets from the first iteration prioritized 8, 7, 5 and at least one of 6 and 4.\\n-The top sets from the second iteration prioritized 10, 9, 5, and 4.\\n-That one person had fractional troops in the second iteration. That seems good and reduces the need to consider draws. Also, that allows one to overshoot a target by a smaller degree, freeing up backups for less-guarded castles.\\n\\nI found the 80th percentile number for each castle from each iteration. I then took the higher of these 80th percentilers of the two iterations and created the set (4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 21, 25, 31, 29, 23). I then treated that as a single entry and found roughly the cheapest way to beat it to 28 points--targeting 10, 7, 6, and 5. I was able to cover these with 85.4 troops. Of course, if I target only those, I have to win every single one of them, or I lose. For that reason, I chose to post a small contingency in 9 and 2 (which will cover me in the case that I lose either 10 or both 6 and 5...  2 had a significantly lower barrier than 3/4, and 9 was somehow softer than 8). I then gave 0.1 troops to 1, 3 and 4 to ensure I outright win any undefended castles. Castle 8 seemed weird to do just 0.1 for, so I threw 1.1 there. Then, adding one more troop to 6 and 7 seemed to have a very good ROI for the other two iterations, so I went ahead and did that.\\n\\nFinal stray observations: I wish I had marked my other two entries in such a way that I could identify them easily. I feel like this one will stand out in the data a lot better (though I suspect a few others will utilize decimal troops as well).</td>\n",

Save the top 50% of the strategies by win % and propagate them to the next round. Repeat for 10,000 rounds.\\r\\nAn interesting property of this game is that strategies are non-transitive in head-to-head matches. Additionally, the best strategy depends on the distribution of the strategies in the competition pool. The computational approach that I took assumes a competition pool of 1/2 \"good-ish\" strategies and 1/2 random strategies. Here's hopin'!

       "3312  A few guiding observations:\n",
       "\\n-The champion sets of the other two had about an 80% win rate. That seems like a good target for this time.\\n-The champion set from the second iteration would have done well on the first. It makes sense to make something that would have done well in the others.\\n-The champion set from the first iteration would have gotten obliterated in the second. It's a good idea not to repeat either of the champions.\\n-The top sets from the first iteration prioritized 8, 7, 5 and at least one of 6 and 4.\\n-The top sets from the second iteration prioritized 10, 9, 5, and 4.\\n-That one person had fractional troops in the second iteration. That seems good and reduces the need to consider draws. Also, that allows one to overshoot a target by a smaller degree, freeing up backups for less-guarded castles.\\n\\nI found the 80th percentile number for each castle from each iteration. I then took the higher of these 80th percentilers of the two iterations and created the set (4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 21, 25, 31, 29, 23). I then treated that as a single entry and found roughly the cheapest way to beat it to 28 points--targeting 10, 7, 6, and 5. I was able to cover these with 85.4 troops. Of course, if I target only those, I have to win every single one of them, or I lose. For that reason, I chose to post a small contingency in 9 and 2 (which will cover me in the case that I lose either 10 or both 6 and 5...  2 had a significantly lower barrier than 3/4, and 9 was somehow softer than 8). I then gave 0.1 troops to 1, 3 and 4 to ensure I outright win any undefended castles. Castle 8 seemed weird to do just 0.1 for, so I threw 1.1 there. Then, adding one more troop to 6 and 7 seemed to have a very good ROI for the other two iterations, so I went ahead and did that.\\n\\nFinal stray observations: I wish I had marked my other two entries in such a way that I could identify them easily. I feel like this one will stand out in the data a lot better (though I suspect a few others will utilize decimal troops as well).   \n",

       "1266  I assumed that most people would submit deployments that perform as well or better than the winner from round 1 (against round 1 submissions). So, I wrote an algorithm that generates a large number of winning deployments against round 1 submissions and then made those compete. The result is a deployment that beats the winner from round 1 and also performs well against other winning deployments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Oddly, I started getting better solutions.

       "2676  I created a giant spreadsheet that I filled with placements from the previous rounds (with winners on the list twice because they rock). Then I built formulas to calculate my win percentage against them and played with my placements. After lots of testing, I chose a modified Vince Vatter (Round 2 champ who) that performed slightly worse that his Round 2 victory in my experiments. I did this because I figured people would note that leaving 0 or 1 soldier in a castle was a bad move and would start leaving 2 or 3. Basically, I did some math then took a guess as to how the masses would behave. My goal is over 80% victory!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

The low ones aren't valuable but I'm more likely to win those outright.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1107  I took a computational approach. First, generate a population of random strategies, then pit them against each other. Save the top 50% of the strategies by win % and propagate them to the next round. Repeat for 10,000 rounds.\\r\\nAn interesting property of this game is that strategies are non-transitive in head-to-head matches. Additionally, the best strategy depends on the distribution of the strategies in the competition pool. The computational approach that I took assumes a competition pool of 1/2 \"good-ish\" strategies and 1/2 random strategies. Here's hopin'!

       "2760  As I expect many to choose low troop numbers for the top castles, I deploy many soldiers there in order to hopefully take those three. After that, only one point is needed to win, so I chose to attack castle 10 in hopes that it is the least guarded. This appears to be a reasonable strategy based on the previous distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

I am guessing that someone will do 100 for 10 and 9, so guessing 8 will be the one where people don't apply 100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
